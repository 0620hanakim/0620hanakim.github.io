  description: The role of platform as an information mediator has been becoming more vital by satisfying buyers’ needs for a reasonable purchase and sellers’ need for more exposure to buyers within the copious information flood. For the platform service provider, increasing the network externality is important to induce both sides while platforms can cause sellers to invest more and create severe competition among sellers, which take a toll on sellers’ surplus. Therefore, this study investigates whether platforms yield benefits for sellers as the platform matures, securing the network externality. Thus, this study divides the seller side industry into 3 periods based on the level of platform maturation. The efficiency in each period is measured using stochastic frontier analysis and efficiencies of each period are compared using meta-frontier analysis. The results show the overall industry efficiency improves with securing the network externality as the platform matures. However, if the individual firm is resistant to innovation, the firm’s efficiency might not be far behind compared to the firm which led the innovation.

- publication: (Selected Publication) Does diversity make collaborative subsidies effective?

  description: Research and development (R&D) collaboration becomes essential as technology becomes more complex, and technological change occurs at an unprecedented rate in high-tech industries such as information and communication technologies (ICT). However, no concrete evidence exists on the benefits of collaboration diversity in terms of government support. Therefore, this paper investigates whether a firm’s innovation increases as not only R&D collaboration partners’ diversity increases, but also firms engage in cross-industry R&D collaboration. The government subsidies for ICT firms collaborating with other firms and research institutions at the same time have significantly positive effects on firm performances. Interestingly, cross-industry collaborations increase innovation activity. This study suggests that firm innovation can be efficiently achieved through R&D partner diversity, and the government should support diverse R&D partners collaboration with different knowledge to generate innovative outcomes.
